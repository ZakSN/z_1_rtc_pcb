this repo has the kicad board files for the z_1 RTC, a (hopefully very accurate)
real time clock. read more about it here: https://hackaday.io/project/180005-a-digital-real-time-clock

technically this is the 3rd version of the PCBs for this project, howerver the
first 2 versions didn't work well enough to bother publishing.

there are also 3 minor versions of the version 3 PCB:
- 3.1 LCMXO2-1200HC-4SG32C on the board (didn't work for mysterious reasons, see link above)
- 3.2 tinyFPGA-Ax2 module on the board (the tinyFPGA is just a carrier for the LCMX02-1200HC-4SG32C)
- 3.3 LCMXO2-2000HC-5TG100I on the board (same as 3.1, except with parts that are actually in stock right now)
